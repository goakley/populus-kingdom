# Populus Kingdom

[itch.io](https://goakley.itch.io/populus-kingdom)

You thought being ruler of the kingdom would be a life of prestige and great power. But really, you're just tasked with assigning people their roles in life. A simple task, to be sure, but can you keep the kingdom alive?

Made in Unity (2019.2).
